# If - Else If - Else Statements

  These are decision-making structures that let a program choose between different paths.

  The program checks the first condition; if it’s true, it runs the associated instructions.

  If the first condition is false, it checks the next condition, and so on.

  If none of the conditions are true, it can run a default set of instructions.

  It’s useful when you want to test multiple conditions in a specific order.

# Switch Case Statement

  This is another decision-making tool, but it’s used when you want to compare one variable against many fixed values.

  The program matches the variable’s value to one of the predefined options.

  When it finds a match, it runs the code related to that choice.

  If no match is found, it can run a default option.

  Switch cases are often easier to read than many if-else statements when checking a single variable against many values.
